# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied After Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes fail to be applied after the build process, even though there are no apparent syntax errors or configuration problems. The issue is likely caused by a conflict between Tailwind's configuration, the build process, or a third-party library.  This repository includes both the buggy code and a potential solution.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains code that uses Tailwind CSS classes.  After following the project's setup and build instructions, the Tailwind classes will not be applied.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential solution.  It addresses the core conflict leading to the issue. Specific changes made should be described in comments within the solution file.
